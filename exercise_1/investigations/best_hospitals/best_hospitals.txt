The hospital with the highest overall high-quality care is HOSPITAL DR SUSONI
INC.  These results are based on the the hospital's timely and effective care
score for hospitals with over 100 samples in survey data. 

I used this score becuase it makes sure there is enough data in the survey
data so that it represents the population and it is an overall score thattakes
into account many differnt procedures over the entire period of time of the
study.

As you can see above, the third column is the average score for the hospital.
